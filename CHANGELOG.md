## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- `.claude/skills/cicd/` — CI/CD workflow skill vendored from
  `agentculture/steward` (replaces `pr-review`). Adds `workflow.sh`
  entry point with portability lint, reviewer-readiness polling, batch
  reply, alignment-delta check, and SonarCloud quality-gate
  integration. Includes an `irc-lens notes` section preserving
  AFI-rubric guardrails (recurring bug classes, PUSHBACK rules for
  `.afi/reference/` and stable-contract files).
- `.claude/skills/communicate/` — cross-repo + Culture-mesh
  communication skill vendored from `agentculture/steward`. Files
  GitHub issues on sibling repos with auto-signature
  `- irc-lens (Claude)` and sends Culture mesh channel messages.

### Changed

- `.gitignore` narrowed from `.claude/` (entire directory) to steward's
  selective pattern: per-user state (`settings.local.json`,
  `scheduled_tasks.lock`, `skills.local.yaml`, `*/local.yaml`,
  `*/scripts/*.local.sh`) stays ignored; tracked skills become
  visible. Closes #30.

### Removed

- `.claude/skills/pr-review/` — superseded by `.claude/skills/cicd/`
  (steward 0.7.0 rename).

### Fixed

- `cicd/scripts/pr-batch.sh` — guarded `jq -r` parses with
  `2>/dev/null || echo "null"` so a malformed JSONL line yields the
  sentinel that the existing null-check catches and skips, instead of
  aborting the entire batch under `set -e`. (Divergence from upstream
  steward; will reconcile when steward picks up the same patch.)
- `cicd/scripts/pr-status.sh` — wrapped each `curl -s` call in command
  substitution with `|| echo '{}'` so transient SonarCloud / network
  failures yield empty JSON instead of empty stdout, preventing
  `workflow.sh await` from crashing on a flaky API call. (Divergence
  from upstream steward; will reconcile.)
