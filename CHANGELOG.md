## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- `.claude/skills/cicd/` — CI/CD workflow skill vendored from
  `agentculture/steward` (replaces `pr-review`). Adds `workflow.sh`
  entry point with portability lint, reviewer-readiness polling, batch
  reply, alignment-delta check, and SonarCloud quality-gate
  integration. Includes an `irc-lens notes` section preserving
  AFI-rubric guardrails (recurring bug classes, PUSHBACK rules for
  `.afi/reference/` and stable-contract files).
- `.claude/skills/communicate/` — cross-repo + Culture-mesh
  communication skill vendored from `agentculture/steward`. Files
  GitHub issues on sibling repos with auto-signature
  `- irc-lens (Claude)` and sends Culture mesh channel messages.

### Changed

- `.gitignore` narrowed from `.claude/` (entire directory) to steward's
  selective pattern: per-user state (`settings.local.json`,
  `scheduled_tasks.lock`, `skills.local.yaml`, `*/local.yaml`,
  `*/scripts/*.local.sh`) stays ignored; tracked skills become
  visible. Closes #30.

### Removed

- `.claude/skills/pr-review/` — superseded by `.claude/skills/cicd/`
  (steward 0.7.0 rename).
